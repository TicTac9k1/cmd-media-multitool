This bat script makes it easier for you to use certain programs that can perform basic tasks quickly and effectively.

It can downscale video media to 720p or 360p
It can convert files to mp3 or mp4
It can open a Twitch stream in a media player to bypass the purple screen
It can make some 4chan webms, though it probably can do a better job if I knew the proper settings
It can download any files from an open directory

youtube-dl and ffmpeg require to be in the same directory as the script
wget and mpc must be installed in their default locations in order for it to work

youtube-dl.exe - https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/releases

wget for Windows - http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm - Required to download entire open directories
